#### Access Token (`product_access_Token`) 

The access token used to log in to a specific product in the  scanner. This is required for some product suites such as Prisma Cloud. In most cases this is a password or an API key. You should [create a secret](/docs/platform/security/add-file-secrets) with your encrypted ID and reference the secret using the format `<+secrets.getValue(project.access-id>`.
